# Sixth Update
This is the sixth update, and will outline the code modifications to the GPU course22 files to solve for Questions 3 and 4.

---
## GPU
The batch sizes can be altered with the addition of the **bs** term in *dataloaders*.
```
dls = DataBlock(
    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock), 
    get_items=get_image_files, 
    splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42),
    get_y=parent_label,
    item_tfms=RandomResizedCrop(224, min_scale=0.3)
).dataloaders(path, bs=64)
```
It was found that GPU was optimally utilised at 88% capacity for batch sizes of 64, as higher batch sizes exceeded this capacity and forced a second evaluation run.

This represents a 900% speed up over the CPU only run, taking only 11 seconds to evaluate what would have taken 99 seconds before.

---
## Multiclass
The code can also be modified to accomodate multiple classes.
This change downloads 400 images for each of the other classes and stores it into the CIFAR10 folder.
```
searches = 'airplane','automobile','bird','cat','deer','dog','frog','horse','ship','truck'
path = Path('CIFAR10')
from time import sleep
```

While this change outputs the corresponding confusion matrix and top losses.
'''
interp = ClassificationInterpretation.from_learner(learn)
interp.plot_confusion_matrix()
'''
```
interp.plot_top_losses(5, nrows=1)
```
| Confusion | Top losses |
